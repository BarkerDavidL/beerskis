                    <p>Dave and Tim are in the mist of packaging up all of our mutual life experiences into one site. 
                        You can think of this as local site combining FB, Twitter, and Tik-Tok features just for our peeps. 
                        We will be creating pages for our excellent past adventures to share with those who enjoyed them with us and 
                           to pass down to our next generation so they can laugh all the silly things we've done. 

                    </p>
