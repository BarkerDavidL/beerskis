              <p>
                Just before the Washington Redskins played in the 1991
                (January 26, 1992) Super Bowl in Minneapolis, MN our 
                group took a 3-night trip to Seven Springs but still
                returned in time to watch the game. Here we are gathering
                for the bus in Tyson's Corner, Virginia. Taking the bus
                always helped us start the party early to get everyone
                warmed up for Thursday night skiing!

                    Wagner Slope, the central run at the base of the front side
                    of Seven Springs mountain.
