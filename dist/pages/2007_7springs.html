                  The fifteenth and last Seven Springs Ski Trip.<br>
                  E-mail from Tim <br> Hey Ya'all,
    Once again, a fine trip it was. Thanks to all for coming along for the ride.
    It was a bit rough getting it together this year, but in the end, I'm sure I'll only remember how fun the trip was.
    By the looks of the pics I took, my guess is you all had a good time as well (some too good :-).
    As I've said before, it's not where you go or what you do, but who you're with that makes good times great. I couldn't ask for better people to party with. Cheers to you.
    As usual, there'll be many Beerski stories from this trip added to stack of stories from previous trips; some good, some bad, but all will be funny in time.
    Tricia/Bernie - I'm very glad you're still with us after doing donuts on I-270. Way too close a call.
    I hope everybody else made it home safely.

    Special thanks to Edie - if not for her truck and patience (far more than my own), we wouldn't have got everyone up and back.
   
    Next year? Who knows? That's a lifetime and hopefully many excellent adventures away.

    I've gone through and edited all 100 or so pictures I took. Nobody on this trip is planning to run for office, right?
    In between way too many photos of Chad (I'm like his personal photographer I guess), I have pictures of PDA, lots of dancing, Rockers w/ bad hair, threesomes on cots, ass shots, and some real good group shots.
   Attached are some of the group shots, the others I may send out only to those in the shots. Yes, that is censorship, but if someone had a picture of me sucking face with someone, I don't think I'd like it if they sent it out to the whole group. Contrary to what some may believe, I try not to be a "jackass" all the time.
  
Thanks to all, hope to see you soon, Tim
