                We commonly tried to take at least one group picture just as we
                gathered to get on the return bus. Many of us just came from the
                hotel lobby bar with bloody marys, a popular pre-bus drink for this
                crowd! Falling asleep first was a bad move - it usually got your face
                decorated.

                    Sometimes people would start to gather in one of the rooms until
                    the whole group piled in. When the room got too crowded, you can
                    see where we'd spill out.
