                <p>Colorado's Grand Mesa sits 12,000 feet above sea level
                   and funnels the moisture in the atmosphere right onto
                   Powerderhorn's ski slopes. Their ski season is abridged
                   due to migrating elk, so get there before the end of 
                   March. In a good season, you'll be skiing knee-deep in
                   fresh deep dry powder. And the feel is local-friendly.
                   Go there often enough and you'll soon be recognizing faces
                   and names of everyone else there.
